This area of research is becoming more and more popular in recent years with more and more publications in top conferences such as NIPS and POPL, attracting researchers from universities such as MIT and Stanford and industry research institutions such as Microsoft Research. However, to our best knowledge, this area has not even been studied in China. We have evaluated the existing probabilistic programming systems including BUGS , Church , FACTORIE , Infer.NET , Dimple , etc. More specifically, BUGS is a language for specifying finite graphical models and accompanying software for performing Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling. Church is a universal probabilistic programming language, extending Scheme with probabilistic semantics, and is well suited for describing infinite-dimensional stochastic processes and other recursively-defined generative processes. Factorial is a Scala library for creating relational factor graphs, estimating parameters and performing inference. Infer.NET is a software library developed by Microsoft for expressing graphical models and implementing Bayesian inference using a variety of algorithms within the .NET platform. Dimple is a software tool that performs inference and learning on probabilistic graphical models via belief propagation algorithms or sampling based algorithms. In summary, all these probabilistic programming languages are extended from a domain language and each of them inherits the same syntax and the data types of the domain language.
