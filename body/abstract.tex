  Probabilistic programming languages are in the spotlight, with their use in machine learning, cognitive science, information retrieval and artificial intelligence fields. Probabilistic programming aims to make the code of probabilistic models shorter, to reduce development time, to facilitate the construction of richer models, to require lower levels of expertise in building machine learning applications, and to support the construction of integrated models. In Probabilistic programming, modeling and inference have been disentangled. There are many existing probabilistic programming systems including BUGS ~\cite{bugs}, Church ~\cite{church}, FACTORIE ~\cite{factorie}, Infer.NET ~\cite{infernet}, Dimple ~\cite{dimple}, etc. The problem is that this is not easy for those cross-platform developments where they have to get accustomed to the different kinds of probabilistic programming languages or libraries. Henceforth, what we proposed is the Portable Probabilistic Programming Framework that can be embedded in every programming language people commonly used. We designed the syntax for the portable probabilistic programming language which targets Bayesian networks and conditional query. The design of the language is based on BUGS ~\cite{bugs} and is more specific and efficient for describing the probabilistic models. The description of the models using the portable probabilistic programming language is separated from the code of the host language as well of the conditional query, which can enhance the reusability of the probabilistic models. The parser is implemented and the inference engine is generated automatically based on the conditional query. The inference algorithm is based on the MCMC sampling, such as Gibbs Sampling or Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm, which is efficient and lightweight to implement. Additionally, the APIs for other languages is attached leveraging some existing development tool such as SWIG(Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) ~\cite{swig}.
