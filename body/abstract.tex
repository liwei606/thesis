  Probabilistic programs are usual functional or imperative programs with two additional constructs: (1) the ability to draw values at random from specified distributions, and (2) the ability to condition values of variables in a program based on observations. Probabilistic programs can represent models from diverse application areas including machine learning, information retrieval, computer vision, coding theory, cryptographic protocols, and biology.
  
  Probabilistic programming aims to make the code of probabilistic models shorter, to reduce development time, to facilitate the construction of richer models, to require lower levels of expertise in building machine learning applications, and to support the construction of integrated models.
  
  Probabilistic programming makes the inference process to be done automatically. Probabilistic inference is the problem of computing an explicit representation of the probability distribution implicitly specified by a probabilistic program. The desired output from inference may vary depending on the application. In Probabilistic programming, modeling and inference have been disentangled.
  
  There are many existing probabilistic programming languages and systems including BUGS ~\cite{bugs}, Church ~\cite{church}, FACTORIE ~\cite{factorie}, Infer.NET ~\cite{infernet}, Dimple ~\cite{dimple}, etc. The problem is that it is not easy for those cross-platform developments where the programmers have to get accustomed to the different kinds of probabilistic programming languages or libraries. Henceforth, in this paper, what we proposed is the Portable Probabilistic Programming Framework that can be embedded in every programming language that people commonly used. We designed the syntax for the portable probabilistic programming language which is a declarative programming language targeting to describe Bayesian networks. The design of the language is based on BUGS ~\cite{bugs} and is more specific and efficient for describing the probabilistic models. The description of the models using the portable probabilistic programming language is separated from the code of the host language as well as the conditional query, which can enhance the reusability of the probabilistic models. The parser is implemented and the inference engine can calculate the result of the query automatically. The inference algorithm is based on sampling, which is efficient and lightweight to implement. Additionally, the APIs for other languages are attached leveraging the wrapper tool - SWIG(Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) ~\cite{swig}.
